***************************** [SNAPSHOT SETTINGS] **************************


INCLUDE_NESTED_DEVICES_IN_SNAPSHOTS = On
# Setting:
# Off or On

# Description:
# Determines whether or not nested Devices (Devices inside of Racks) will be
# included in Snapshots. This setting only applies if you're using Live 8.2.2
# or later.

***************************** [EXTRA PREFS] **************************


PROCESS_XCLIPS_IF_TRACK_MUTED = True
# Setting:
# True or False

# Description:
# Determines whether or not X-Clips on a Muted Track will be processed.



STARTUP_ACTIONS = Off
# Setting:
# Off or Action(s) to perform on set load.

# Description:
# Performs an Action List when a set is loaded.



NAVIGATION_HIGHLIGHT = On
# Setting:
# On or Off

# Description:
# Displays a highlight around the selected Clip.



EXCLUSIVE_ARM_ON_SELECT = Off
# Setting:
# On or Off

# Description:
# Upon selecting Tracks, if the selected Track can be armed, it will be armed 
# and any other armed Tracks will be disarmed.

# Note:
# This function may produce undesirable results if Select On Launch is on
# in your Live preferences.


    
EXCLUSIVE_SHOW_GROUP_ON_SELECT = Off
# Setting:
# On or Off

# Description:
# Upon selecting Tracks, if the selected Track is a Group Track, it will be 
# unfolded and any other Group Tracks will be folded.

# Note:
# This function may produce undesirable results if Select On Launch is on
# in your Live preferences.



CLIP_RECORD_LENGTH_SET_BY_GLOBAL_QUANTIZATION = Off
# Setting:
# On or Off

# Description:
# This changes the behavior of launching the selected Clip Slot so that 
# (under the Conditions listed below) you can easily record a new Clip with a length 
# defined by the Global Quantization value.  This will do nothing if the Conditions 
# below aren't met.

# Conditions:
# - Selected Track is armed  
# - Selected Clip Slot has no Clip on it
# - Global Quantization is not set to None



DEFAULT_INSERTED_MIDI_CLIP_LENGTH = 0
# Setting:
# 0 (for Off) or 2 - 16 (for number of bars to use)

# Description:
# Upon inserting a blank MIDI Clip onto the selected Clip Slot, the Clip's length
# will be set to the length (in bars) specified in the setting above.

# Note:
# This will not change the default zoom setting of the Clip, so you'll only see the 
# Clip's first bar. You'll need to zoom out to see the rest of the Clip.



***************************** [CSLINKER] **************************


# CSLinker allows you to link the grid selectors (colored borders around clips) of 
# two Control Surfaces either horizontally or vertically.    

# The Control Surface script names to use are as shown in Live's Control Surface chooser.  
# If a Control Surface's name has a space in it (like MXT Live), you should use an underscore 
# in place of the space (like MXT_Live).

# Note, Push and Push2 cannot be used for matched linking.  Additionally, horizontal linking
# with Push2 may produce undesirable results due to Push2's inclusion of Chain mixer settings
# along side normal Track mixer settings. 


CSLINKER_MATCHED_LINK = False
# Setting:
# True for matched link or False for horizonal/vertical link.

# Description:
# Determines whether the two Control Surfaces should have a matched link meaning that
# they will lay on top of each other.  This setting overrides CSLINKER_HORIZONTAL_LINK.
# and CSLINKER_MULTI_AXIS_LINK.



CSLINKER_HORIZONTAL_LINK = True
# Setting:
# True for horizontal link or False for vertical link.

# Description:
# Determines whether the two Control Surfaces should be horizontal or vertically linked.



CSLINKER_MULTI_AXIS_LINK = False

# Setting:
# None (to turn linking off) or the name of a Control Surface.

CSLINKER_SCRIPT_2_NAME = None
# Setting:
# None (to turn linking off) or the name of a Control Surface.

******************************* [USER CONTROLS] ******************************* 


# Below, you can specify a list of MIDI Controls to use as X-Controls. 

# The entry format is: CONTROL_NAME = MSG_TYPE, MIDI_CHANNEL, NOTE_OR_CC_NUM, ON_ACTION_LIST

# CONTROL_NAME = A unique one-word name (Identifier) for the control. See [IDENTIFIER NOTE] below. 
# MSG_TYPE = The word Note or CC.
# MIDI_CHANNEL = The MIDI Channel number in the range of 1 - 16
# NOTE_OR_CC = The Note or CC number in the range of 0 - 127.
# ON_ACTION_LIST = The Action List to perform when the control sends an on message.

# Example: MY_BTN1 = NOTE, 1, 10, 1/MUTE ; 2/MUTE


# You can optionally specify an Action List to perform when the control sends an off message.
# To do this, place a comma after the On Action List and then specify the Off Action List.

# Example: MY_BTN2 = CC, 16, 117, 1/MUTE ; 2/MUTE, 3/PLAY >


# To perform the same Action List for the On Action List and Off Action List, just specify an asterick 
# for the Off Action List.  

# Example: MY_BTN3 = NOTE, 5, 0, 1/MUTE, *


# Below is an example list that has been commented out (the # at the beginning of 
# a line makes the line a comment). Your list should be formatted in the same way 
# except without the # at the beginning of each line.


# btn_1 = note, 1, 0, mute , *

# btn_2 = note, 1, 1, solo

# btn_3 = cc, 9, 2, arm

# btn_4 = cc, 9, 3, mon

******************************* [USER VARIABLES] ******************************* 


# Below, you can specify a list of Variables to use in your Action Lists.

# The entry format is: VARIABLE_NAME = VALUE

# VARIABLE_NAME = A unique one-word name (Identifier) for the variable. See [IDENTIFIER NOTE] below.  
# VALUE = Any value or word or combination of words. See the User Variables section of the manual for
# more info on this.  

# The Variables listed below are just examples and can be removed.


ex_var1 = 10
ex_var2 = mute


******************************* [IDENTIFIER NOTE] *******************************


# Identifiers and Variable names should not contain characters other than letters, numbers and underscores.  
# Also, Variable names and their values are not case-sensitive.
